#+TITLE: vterm-ring

* Simply manage vterm buffers
Manage multiple vterm buffers through these simple commands:
- =vterm-ring-new=: create a new vterm buffer
- =vterm-ring-next=: switch to either an existing vterm buffer, or bring one into focus
- =vterm-ring-prev=: similar to =vterm-ring-next=

This is supposed to be a much simpler version of [[https://github.com/suonlight/multi-vterm/tree/36746d85870dac5aaee6b9af4aa1c3c0ef21a905][multi-vterm]].
